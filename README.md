[ASP.NET Core Responsive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wangkanai/Responsive/dev/asset/asp.net-core-responsive.svg?sanitize=true)

ASP.NET Core Responsive middleware for routing base upon request client device detection to specific view.
Being to target difference client devices with seperation of concern is crucial, due to you can mininize what is sent to the client directly from the service to only what is needed and nothing more. This increase performance and lower bandwidth usage.

## Installation

Installation of Responsive library will bring in all dependency packages.

```powershell
PM> install-package Wangkanai.Responsive -pre
```

## Configure Service

Responsive is configured in the `ConfigureServices` method:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Add responsive services.
    services.AddResponsive()
        .AddViewSuffix()
        .AddViewSubfolder();

    // Add framework services.
    services.AddMvc();  
}
```

* `AddResponsive()` Adds the Responsive services to the services container.
* `AddViewSuffix()` Adds support for device view files  to `Suffix`. In this sample view Responsive is based on the view file suffix. 

  Ex `*views/[controller]/[action]/index.mobile.cshtml*`

* `AddViewSubfolder()` Adds support for device view files to `Subfolder`. In this sample view Responsive is based on the view file subfolder. 

  Ex `*views/[controller]/[action]/mobile/index.cshtml*`

## Configure Middleware

The current device on a request is set in the Responsive middleware. The Responsive middleware is enabled in the `Configure` method of *Startup.cs* file.

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
{
    app.UseResponsive();

    app.UseMvc(routes =>
    {
        routes.MapRoute(
            name: "default",
            template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });
}
```

* `UseResponsive()` Add the responsive middleware into the http pipeline. Its will capture the request and resolve the device to responsive services container.

## Customized able options (beta 3)

This enable the middleware to customized the default response for any type of request device to the configured options.

```
app.UseResponsive(new ResponsiveOptions
{
    TabletDefault = DeviceType.Mobile
});
```

* `ResponsiveOptions` has 3 default configurable via `DesktopDefault`, `TabletDefault`, and `MobileDefault`.
